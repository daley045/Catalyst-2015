Jentery Sayers, Assistant Professor, English and Social, Cultural, and Political Thought; Director, Maker Lab in the Humanities, University of Victoria lost the battle against [Skalgubbar's](http://skalgubbar.se/) decentralized photo storage and a robot from wordpress! However, Professor Sayers succeeded in teaching us about computer vision, markdown, and photogrammetry!

Today was a great introduction into the fascinating topic of computer vision. First, we discussed the representational applications of computer vision: pattern recognition, documentation, and analysis. The we touched on some of the speculative uses of computer vision to do a little dreaming about how the use and misuse of digital perception can help us to design and represent our world in new and fascinating ways!
