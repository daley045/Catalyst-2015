#Photogrammetry 101

Frist, as a group, we collected an image sequence of Rapson Hall. In three group we too photographs of the exterior of the building. Then we broke up into smaller groups. With George and Dustin we collected an image sequence of the front office and entry. With photograps of the ground, middle, and sky. We hope that together these images create a more refined model of the entry. Personally, I was interested in inverting the technology to define spaces. Therefore, I selected the "fountian" courtyard and documented it from the center looking outward. Finally. In case this did not priduce a refined model I took an image sequence of Adam Marcuss' concrete wall.
