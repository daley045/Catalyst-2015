###Perceptual Contour
* document light and shadow on the building facade as a way to understand the mass. Allow the machine way of seeing to accentuate the missreading of the building. Then Translate these mistakes into a digital model.

###The Implications of the Door
* document just doors arround the Twin Cites as a way to understand consistancy and differnces between regions. The door becomes an indicator for many other unrepresented conditions.

###Building Contour Reveals
* document building outline is used to understand the code that shade the building. 

###Croud Perception of Facades
* pull images from databases of public photos to create a digital model of how the public percieves a building facade. Here there would be large biases for the building files.
